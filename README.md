As we already know, Wartune is a pay to win game with a lot of issues and sometimes you just get bored and frustated and just dont want to make those repetitive tasks as Astral and Altar.  

In this repository I present you some Python scripts that automate some of those process. There is much to better but I think its better to use these scripts than nothing.  

Observe that there scripts takes specifics positions of the screen to click in the correct buttons and need some ability and knowledgment about Python to use.  

If you like it and want to contribute feel free to submit your pull request.  

You can also fork and use these scripts as you want, for commercial and non-commercial projects.

- **Python**  
    _I'm using Python 3.11.8_
